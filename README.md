The code behind https://generated.pictures .

It's extremely simple at the moment, and I'd like to keep it as-is for the moment.

The Javascript 'app' requires a file named **paths.json**, which is
generated by the Ruby script provided.

I choose Ruby because writing quick one-liners is very easy with Ruby.  
Since I need to output a JSON file, bash scripts are a no-no here.  
Python could do the trick, though.

## Generating **path.json**

```bash
ruby generate.rb
```
